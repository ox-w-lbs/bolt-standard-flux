# bolt-standard-flux

An electrode standard configuration and task for building application.

Meant to be used with `electrode-bolt` ([on walmartreact github[(https://github.com/walmartreact/electrode-bolt)).

## Usage

Within your project directory where `electrode-bolt` is also a dependency:

```
$ npm install bolt-standard-flux
```

Now whenever you run `bolt` it will use the scripts preferred for the standard recommended `flux` architecture.
